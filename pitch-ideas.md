## 2nd Idea

### Project Name: NoseGoes

Project idea:  
The idea of this project was to have a user search and see a calendar of events in the ir current area.
The API call would return dates, locations and the name of events. It was never pursued due to the number of variables we had to consider as well the lack of user fucntionality and the unavaiability to meet CRUD requirements we started to "rabbit hole" into different realms of ideas and the project started to seem to large and complicated.
